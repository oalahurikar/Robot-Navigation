Problem 1: Training accuracy stuck at 49.5% and training stopping at epoch 26? Why?
 The Problem:
Validation loss stopped improving after epoch 10 and actually got worse at epoch 20. With a patience of 15 epochs, the model waited 16 epochs (from epoch 10 to epoch 26) without improvement, triggering early stopping.

ðŸš¨ Root Causes:
Learning Rate Too High: 0.001 might be causing the model to overshoot optimal weights
Small Dataset: Only 698 training samples for 2,852 parameters (2.5 parameters per sample is borderline)
High Validation Loss: 1.26+ suggests the model is struggling to learn the patterns
Low Accuracy: ~43-49% accuracy indicates the model isn't learning effectively

ðŸŽ¯ Things to Try next
Experiment 1:
```
training:
  learning_rate: 0.0005  # Reduce learning rate
  early_stopping:
    patience: 25         # Increase patience
    min_delta: 0.0001    # More sensitive to small improvements

model:
  dropout_rate: 0.1      # Reduce dropout slightly
```

Experiment 1 Results => After above changes early stopping at 51 epoch and accuracy reached to 51%

Experiment 2: Increased training data from 810 to 8100 samples (Large data set)
Experiment 2 Results => After above changes early stopping at 51 epoch and accuracy reached to 51%
